# Face Detection Using TensorFlow and JavaScript
This project implements real-time face detection using TensorFlow.js in the browser. The model detects faces in an image or live video feed, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces.

# Key Features:
  TensorFlow.js: Utilizes the TensorFlow.js library for running machine learning models directly in the browser.
  Real-Time Face Detection: Detects faces in real time from a video feed using a pre-trained model.
  Lightweight & Fast: No need for server-side processing, making it a lightweight and responsive solution.
  Cross-Platform: Runs on any platform that supports JavaScript and a web browser.
# Technologies Used:
  TensorFlow.js
  JavaScript
  HTML5 & CSS3
